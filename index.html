        <div  class = "Div1 divText">Tim John Berners-Lee is an Computer Scientist born in London, England. <br>
        He went to Sheen Mount Primary School, Emanuel School, and finally graduated from The Queen's College, Oxford in 1976. <br>
        Well, what is he known for, and why are you reading this?</div>
        <div class = "indexDiv2 divText">That is because Tim Berners-Lee is celebrated as the inventor of the World Wide Web.<br>
            In 1989, CERN (the company Berners worked at) was the largest Internet node in Europe, so Berners-Lee decided to use this to his advantage.<br>
            Researchers all around the world needed a more efficient way to exchange data and information.<br>
            Because of this, he proposed taking the hypertext idea, and joining it to the TCP and DNS, and that's how the World Wide Web was created!<br>
            This new integration allowed users to navigate between documents easily, which created a universal space for information.<br>
        </div>
        <div class = "indexDiv3 divText">
            By 1991, the first website was live, which marked the dawn of the web.<br>His invention transformed the distribution of information as we know it.<br>It fundamentally changed how people access and share knowledge with eachother<br>

            It's literally how you're reading this webpage right now!<br>
            We can say one thing for certain: without this invention, technology, internet and even life wouldn't be what it is today.
