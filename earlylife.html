        <div class = "Div1 divText">Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8th, 1955, in London; his mother a mathematician and his father a computer scientist.<br>
        Both his father and mother were part of the team that worked on the first commercially available computer.<br> Because of the fact that he grew up in such a household with innovative minds, he was exposed to computing from a young age.
        </div>
        <div class = "earlyLifeDiv2 divText">When he was a teenager, Berners developed an interest in tinkering with electronics (likely due to the nature of his home).<br>
        He spent a lot of his time disassembling and reassembling certain gadgets; he even built a basic computer using an old TV set!<br>
        Throughout his childhood, and through the works of his, he was able to grasp the fundamentals of computers and their software. 
        <br>This layed the groundwork for the innovations of his later life.
        </div>
        <div class = "earlyLifeDiv3 divText">After completing High school, Berners-Lee attended The Queen's College at Oxford University to study physics.<br>
            Although completing a degree in physics, he still continued to pursue his passion for Computer Science, even going as fair as to building his own computer with spare parts.<br>
        All of this truly showed just how deep he was in the path of Computer Science, and was a foreshadow of what he would become.  </div>
